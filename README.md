- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander @KajAlTUU
- 👀 I’m interested into develop innovation automatic electric systems based on MicroControllers. This direction actually combine two thing that I like to - engeneering and programming.
- 🌱 That's why I’m currently learning C++ and different families of MicroControllers in parallel.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with companies which can accept me on junior or trainee C++ developer position. But also interested just communicate with like-minded people.
